## What IRC servers can I connect to? ##

The information provided on the [main page](/) should work fine under most
circumstances.

It is possible to force IPv4 (irc4.oftc.net) or IPv6 (irc6.oftc.net) if your
network does not handle this gracefully.

Do not connect to individual servers, always let the DNS rotation pick one for
you. This employs GeoDNS to take you to a server nearby. It also allows us to
do load-balancing on servers and take out servers that will go down for
maintenance.

## What are "Services"? ##

On OFTC's IRC network, in order to improve the user's experience, we allow the
use of a software package which is typically classed as "Services." The systems
included, and their uses, are: NickServ, which is responsible for nickname
registration and user preferences; ChanServ, responsible for channel
registration,control, and preferences.

Details are explained on the [Services](/Services) page. Please also see [the
frequently asked questions about Services](../Services).

## What User Modes are available? ##

Please see [User Modes](/UserModes) for more information

## What Channel Modes are available? ##

Please see [Channel Modes](/ChannelModes) for more information

## Why am I port-scanned on connect? ##

To keep trojaned hosts away, we try to identify open proxies and similar
services on connecting clients. Please just ignore connections from
zombie-scan.oftc.net, the connects are harmless. (If you really don't like them,
use a firewall.)

## Who are all these users with the host-mask nickname.something.oftc.net? ##

 * `<nickname>.<role>.oftc.net` is a [Staff](/staff) member, they have these masks
to be easily identified as to what role they play. A complete explanation is
available at [Staff](/staff)
 * `<nickname>.user.oftc.net` is a user cloak. Please see
[UserCloaks](/UserCloaks) for more information.

## How can I sponsor a server or join the project's staff? ##

OFTC's survival depends on the generous contributions of server sponsors and
volunteers. The current application form is located at
[Application](/Application).

## What is OFTC's IRC server naming scheme? ##

OFTC's server naming scheme is "science terms, except people's names".
